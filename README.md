Ultimate Tic Tac Toe written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Rules:
1) Player X can place their first move anywhere on the board (any section of the large board and any space in the smaller boards)
2) The next player must play in the grid on the larger board that corresponds with the last players move on the smaller board

Example with coordinates:
00 01 02
10 11 12
20 21 22

  If X plays in space 02 on the small board, O must place their next move on the small board located in 02 coordinate of the large board (note: can place their token on any space in the smaller board)

  If O then places their token on 20 of the small board, X must place their next token on the small board located in 20 of the large board (note: can place their token on any space in the smaller board)
